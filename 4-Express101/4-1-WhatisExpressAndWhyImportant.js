//What is Express?
    //https://expressjs.com
    //'Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framwork for Node.js'
    
    //Ryan Dahl took the V8 engine out of chrome and turned it into Node JS
    //Express is a framework that runs in Node JS
    //Node JS is not written in JavaScript, it is written in C
    
    //'Unopinionated' - means they don't force things on you
        //Ruby on Rails coralls you into using postgresql
        //If you know what you want to use, then this is good

//Why use Express?
    //Express gives us a bunch of shortcuts that we would have to implement ourselves (see nodeJS server we made)
    //Performant
    //Implement APIs quickly and easily

    //As a developer, Express is a routing and middleware web framework
        //Middleware - allow us to affect and manipulate request and response object
    
    //Express seeks to make life easier for us by taking care of all the things that
        //are common (That's what a framework does)
        //A router makes routing easier, so we don't have to do the routing ourselves.
        //And it offers us the chance to write middleware (manipulate req, res objects)
