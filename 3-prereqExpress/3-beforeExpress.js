//Pre-Express
    //Typically associated with express:
        //mongoDB
        //React
        //Angular
        //node.js
        //MySQL
        //PostGreSQL
    
    //socket.io - real-time communication
    
    //Whenever you use any of those things mentioned above,
        //express takes a backseat
    
    //Though those things above assume you're going to use express

    //The course is made for you to get a good foundation of express
        //before you use those other technologies that utilize express as well
    
    //However, we need to talk about 2 things before we talk about express
        //1. HTTP - hypertext transfer protocol -> TCP/UDP 
        //2. NodeJS webserver - we will make a webserver without using express
            //Express is just a node module
            //So, node can live without Express, but Express cannot live without node

            //So, first, we try to see how node would do things without express
                //That will help elucidate, how express works and why it is important
