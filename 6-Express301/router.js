//express.Router()
    //Router method is essentialyl a little mini application 
        //inside of our express app
    //It's only job is to handle middleware and handle routes
    //It behaves like middleware, but its a really nice way to modularize your app
        //So that our app.get()/app.post()/ etc. All of them will be contained in the router.
        //This allows for modularity and organization and easier coding and maintainence

    //The router makies it easy to modularize and put all the routes and middleware in a different file.
