<!--Here, we demonstrate a common use case where you have a front end that wamts to make an ajax  request

-->

<!--link from google search google jquery-->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

<!--
    We make a get request by going to 'localhost:3000/ajax.html' in our browser
    When ajax.html loads, the script below will run.
    The script runs the ajax request (ourRequst) will take place
    Our ajax request here, will make a POST HTTP request to localhost:3000/ajax 
    The datatype of the ajax request is 'json'
    and the data we are sending is {name: "Rob"} (which is json format).
    Because jquery always returns a 'promise', there is a '.then'
    The callback of the '.then' just logs the response so we know we got something back
    When the 'ourRequest' is fulfilled, the callback function is run which logs back the response.

    Because ajax.html file is located in 'public' folder, it will automatically load if we just go to localhost:3000/ajax.html
-->

<script>
    const ourRequest = $.ajax({
        method: "POST",
        url: "http://localhost:3000/ajax",
        dataType: "json",
        data:{
            name: "Rob"
        }
    })

    ourRequest.then( (response) => {
        console.log(response);
    })
</script>
