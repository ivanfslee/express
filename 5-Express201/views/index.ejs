<!-- msg and msg2 is from ejsPractice.js -->
<!-- index.ejs was passed data into it -->
<!-- We essentially have a bridge between the ejs file and our express server -->
<!-- The DOM is built, we get the data from Express, that is written directly to our response before we ever send it out -->

<!-- Our browser will only ever get <h1>Success!</h1> -->
<!-- Our browser will only ever get <h1>Failure!</h1> -->
<!-- Browser will not see or know of the ejs code -->

<h1><%= msg %></h1>
<h1><%= msg2 %></h1>
<br>

<!-- Another way to access msg and msg2 is through res.locals property -->
    <!-- Here, in the ejs file, it is already assumed that we are in the 'res', response object -->
    <!-- The object we pass into res.render()  is appended to res.locals-->
    <!-- res.locals is passed down through each middleware and can be accessed by each middleware in the req/res cycle -->
        <!-- So res.locals.msg can be accessed in the ejs file by locals.msg-->
        <!-- So res.locals.msg2 can be accessed in the ejs file by locals.msg2-->

<h1><%= locals.msg %></h1>
<h1><%= locals.msg2 %></h1>

<!-- locals.validated is accessed from the validatedUser middleware defined in our express server -->
<!-- The server set res.locals.validated to true -->
<!-- Because ejs can access res.locals, we can access the validated property here -->
<h1><%= locals.validated %></h1>

<!-- All our view files (ejs files) have access to res.locals -->
<!-- It is already understood that we are accessing res.locals, so we can remove the 'locals' -->

<h3><%= msg %></h3>
<h3><%= msg2 %></h3>
<h3><%= validated %></h3>

<!-- %- percent sign with a dash means to tell the browser to interpret it rather than just print it -->
<!-- Interpret it rather than just print it off as text -->
<!-- %= percent sign with equals sign means to just print it (prints non-escaped stuff)-->
<!-- Because 'html' value is a base64 encoded image, we use ejs' %- syntax to tell browser -->
<!-- to interpret the base64 rather than just print it -->
<!-- If we do '%= html' it will just print out the literal base64 string -->
<%= html %>
<%- html %>

<!-- EJS comments are done with '%#' -->
<!-- It will not show in the DOM or anywhere else other than our code base -->
<%# This is a comment %>

<!-- '!--' These are HTML comments -->
<!-- They WILL show up in the DOM -->

<h3>If you want to output this "<%%" as a literal, this is how to do it.</h3>
