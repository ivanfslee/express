<!-- msg and msg2 is from ejsPractice.js -->
<!-- index.ejs was passed data into it -->
<!-- We essentially have a bridge between the ejs file and our express server -->
<!-- The DOM is built, we get the data from Express, that is written directly to our response before we ever send it out -->

<!-- Our browser will only ever get <h1>Success!</h1> -->
<!-- Our browser will only ever get <h1>Failure!</h1> -->
<!-- Browser will not see or know of the ejs code -->

<h1><%= msg %></h1>
<h1><%= msg2 %></h1>
<br>

<!-- Another way to access msg and msg2 is through res.locals property -->
    <!-- Here, in the ejs file, it is already assumed that we are in the 'res', response object -->
    <!-- The object we pass into res.render()  is appended to res.locals-->
        <!-- So res.locals.msg can be accessed in the ejs file by locals.msg-->
        <!-- So res.locals.msg2 can be accessed in the ejs file by locals.msg2-->

<h1><%= locals.msg %></h1>
<h1><%= locals.msg2 %></h1>
